```

<a id="module-8"></a>

### Module 8

<a id="module-8-cot-property-management"></a>

#### Chain of thought – property management

```markdown
Act as a senior property manager. Think step-by-step and explain your reasoning. I manage a 120-unit Class B multifamily in Dallas at 94% occupancy. Market comps are $1.55–$1.65 per sq ft, and our average is $1.50. How should I adjust rents for renewals and new leases over the next 90 days? Provide your logic before your recommendation.
```

<a id="module-8-cot-delinquency"></a>

#### Chain of thought – delinquency & collections

```markdown
Think step-by-step like a regional manager. Our 200-unit property has 8% delinquency vs 3% portfolio average. Provide a root-cause analysis and a 4-week action plan to reduce delinquency to 4%. Show your reasoning first, then give a concise action checklist for site staff.
```

<a id="module-8-cot-detailed"></a>

#### Chain of thought – detailed risk analytics

```markdown
You are a senior risk-analytics consultant. Think step by step and do not skip any reasoning.

Step 1 – Clarify the problem:
Restate, in your own words, the challenge of rising loan delinquency and collections pressure so you are certain you understand it.

Step 2 – Root-cause exploration:
List at least five plausible, distinct causes of the delinquency spike. For each cause, briefly explain the underlying mechanism (e.g., macro-economic, product-design, operational).

Step 3 – Evidence check:
For every cause you named, brainstorm the specific data signals or KPIs you would inspect to confirm or refute that cause (e.g., DTI ratios, contact-rate metrics).

Step 4 – Remediation blueprint:
Build a structured plan that maps each confirmed cause to concrete actions, grouped into near-term (<90 days), mid-term (3–12 months), and long-term (>1 year) initiatives.

For every action, note the expected impact and an owner. After completing the four steps above, present a concise executive summary (≤150 words) that ties everything together. Reveal your reasoning for Steps 1–3 before showing the final blueprint and summary.
```

<a id="module-8-few-shot"></a>

#### Few-shot – learn my tone

```markdown
Here are 3 example emails I’ve sent to residents. Learn my tone and structure:

[Paste Email 1: friendly, clear late fee reminder]
[Paste Email 2: community event invite]
[Paste Email 3: policy update]

Now, using the same tone and format, write an email informing residents that the hot water will be shut off on Saturday from 9am–1pm for maintenance. Include: reason, timing, what residents should do, and an apology for the inconvenience.
```

#### Multi-step
```markdown
Map out current process
Act as an operations consultant. I’ll describe our current turn/make-ready process for a 200-unit property. 
Turn this into a clear step-by-step process map. Here’s our current approach: [describe current steps].

Identify Improvements
Based on this process map, identify the top 5 bottlenecks or inefficiencies and propose specific improvements for each, focused on reducing vacancy days.

(Create SOP & checklist) – Create SOP & checklist Now draft a standard operating procedure and a make-ready checklist for onsite staff incorporating these improvements. Format the checklist as bullet points that can be printed and used during unit turns.

#### Prompt refinement assistant 1

```markdown
You are an expert in [Subject Matter Expert]. First, ask me 3 short clarifying questions about my intent around [subject], but ask them ONE at a time, waiting for my answer before asking the next. After I’ve answered all 3, use all my answers, along with the original request, to perform a detailed analysis and propose a structured plan of action. Do not start the analysis until all 3 questions have been answered.

#### Prompt refinement assistant 2

```markdown
You are an expert in prompt engineering. Helping me refine my prompts about [delinquency and collections].

For every question I ask:
1) Before answering, propose 2 sharper, more precise rephrasings of my question.
2) Ask me which version I prefer (Option A or Option B), or if I want to keep my original.
3) After I choose, answer the selected version in depth. Always follow this sequence and never skip the refinement step.

#### Example 1 – rent strategy for underperforming property

```markdown
You are a strategic consultant for a 150-unit Class B multifamily property in a secondary market. Occupancy has dropped from 97% to 90% in 4 months, and two new competitors have opened nearby offering aggressive concessions.

Think step by step and make your reasoning explicit at each step. Do not skip reasoning, even if it seems obvious. If you are uncertain, clearly state what you are unsure about instead of guessing.

Use the following 4-step structure and the same style as the example:

**Step 1 – Understand the Problem**  
- What is the core question or decision to be made about rent and concessions over the next 90 days?  
- What are the constraints (budget, time, resources, owner preferences)?  
- Explain your reasoning for how you define the problem.

**Step 2 – Gather Evidence**  
- What data points are most relevant (occupancy, traffic, conversions, comps, concessions, reviews, unit mix, etc.)?  
- What patterns or trends emerge?  
- What is missing or uncertain?
- Explain how you chose the data and what each pattern suggests.

**Step 3 – Evaluate Options**  
List 3–4 possible courses of action. For each, provide Pros, Cons, Risk level (1–5), and Estimated impact, and briefly explain your reasoning.

| Option | Pros | Cons | Risk (1–5) | Impact (Low/Med/High) |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| [A]    |    |    |    |    |
| [B]    |    |    |    |    |
| [C]    |    |    |    |    |

**Step 4 – Synthesize Recommendation**  
- Which option is best and why?  
- What are the first 3 actions to take?  
- What metrics will measure success?  
- Clearly connect your recommendation back to the evidence and trade-offs above.

**Test:**  
Challenge your recommendation by asking:  
- "What would need to be true for this to fail?"  
- Identify those conditions and propose mitigation steps.  
- Verify that the recommendation logically follows from the evidence and reasoning you provided.
```

#### Example 2 – capital project decision

```markdown
You manage a 250-unit Class C community with aging infrastructure. Ownership is considering a major capital spend next year: either (A) a full roof replacement or (B) adding/upgrading resident amenities (fitness room + outdoor lounge). Budget will only cover one major project this year.

Use a structured, step-by-step approach to:
- Clarify the core decision and constraints.
- Identify and interpret the most relevant data points (roof condition, leak history, amenity competitiveness, NOI impact, risk exposure).
- Evaluate at least 3 options (roof first, amenities first, hybrid) with pros, cons, risk level, and expected impact.
- Recommend which project to prioritize this year and why, including the first 3 actions and metrics to track.
- Stress-test your recommendation by stating what would need to be true for it to be the wrong call, and how you would mitigate that risk.

#### 30-day AI learning plan

```markdown
I want to become exceptionally skilled at working with AI tools in my role as a [your job title, e.g., Property Manager, Marketing Director, Financial Analyst].  
I can dedicate about [X minutes] per day for the next 30 days, and I want practical, on-the-job improvements rather than abstract theory.

Act as an AI learning coach and workflow designer specializing in helping [your job title] rapidly adopt AI tools for real-world, day-to-day work.  
You understand common tools in this domain (general-purpose LLMs + role-specific tools), typical workflows, and where AI realistically adds the most value.

Design a 30-day, role-specific AI learning plan that includes:  
- The top 3 AI tools I should master for my specific role (at least one should be a general-purpose LLM; others can be domain-specific or adjacent productivity tools).  
- One high-impact, practical use case per tool that would deliver immediate, tangible value in my current job.  
- The most common mistakes or misuse patterns people in my role have when using these tools.  
- Clear criteria and methods to evaluate AI output for quality, accuracy, and trustworthiness (how to fact-check, how to spot weak reasoning, when not to trust it).  
- A daily practice routine for 30 days that builds my "AI collaboration" skills over time (e.g., prompt design, iteration, review, and reflection), assuming limited time each day.

Respond in the following structured format:

Summary (2–3 sentences)
- Briefly state the learning goal and what I will be able to do after 30 days.

Top 3 Tools Table
- A table with columns: `Tool`, `Why It Matters for [your job title]`, `Primary Use Case`, `Secondary Use Cases`.

Practical Use Cases (One Section per Tool)
- For each tool:  
  - Scenario: brief description tied to my role.  
  - Example Prompt / Workflow: a concrete prompt or short workflow I can run this week.  
  - Expected Outcome: what "success" looks like.

Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them
- 3–5 bullet points per tool highlighting typical errors and how to correct them.

Evaluating AI Output
- A checklist or bullet list answering:  
  - How to check for factual accuracy.  
  - How to evaluate reasoning quality.  
  - How to adapt or correct outputs for my specific context.  
  - When I must override or ignore the AI.

30-Day Daily Practice Plan
- A table with 30 rows (Day 1–30) and columns:  
  - Day  
  - Focus (Tool / Skill)  
  - 10–30 min Exercise (specific action/prompt to try)  
  - Reflection Question (1 question I answer about what I learned).

Final Tips for Sustaining AI Mastery
- 5–7 concise tips on how to keep improving with these tools after the 30 days.
- Practical, non-hyped, and realistic about limitations.  
- Tailored to a [your job title] with real-world constraints (limited time, competing priorities).  
- Encouraging but direct; focus on concrete actions, not vague inspiration.

- Avoid hedge words: "might," "perhaps," "potentially" unless uncertainty is real.
- Don't stack hedging phrases: "may potentially," "it's important to note that."
- Don't create perfectly symmetrical paragraphs or lists that start with "Firstly ... Secondly ..."
- Remove Unicode artifacts when copy-pasting: smart quotes (""), em-dashes, non-breaking spaces.
- Use `’` instead of ``.
